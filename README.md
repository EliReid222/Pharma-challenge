- The data below evaluates squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a form of skin cancer, medication effectiveness against tumors in mice. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. One thousand mice were examined in this study with nine different medications and one placebo. The main purpose of the study is to compare the drug "Capomulin" against competitors in the marketplace. The study includes almost the same amount of females as males, seperated by less than a 1%. The drugs used in the expereiment include "Capomulin", "Ketapril", "Propriva", "Ceftamin", "Infubinol", "Naftsol", "Ramicane", "Stelasyn", and "Zoniferol". Factors taken in to account for this study include the volume of the tumor, the drug used, the gender of the mice, the age of the mice, and weight of the mice. After careful review of the data the following conclusions are backed by the data:

• Capomulin's efectivenes ranked in the top 3 of the competition
• The more the mice weighed the bigger the tumor
• Tumor volume decreased at a rate for Capomilin only Ramicane could compare to
• Gender did not play a role in effectiveness

Overall, Capomulin produces results that fair well against the competition. Capomulin will be one of the most effective drugs in the SCC arena.
